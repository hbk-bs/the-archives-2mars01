			<h3>Semester Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				At the beginning of the first semester, I was a bit surprised by how intensively we focused on programming. 
				I felt overwhelmed and had difficulty imagining how I would manage the semester. However, the more tasks we worked on, 
				the more confident I became. Programming is not such a mystery after all! Working with HTML and CSS came relatively 
				easily to me, as I quickly understood that HTML defines the layout of the page while CSS handles the styling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the tools we used was <strong>p5.js</strong>, a JavaScript library designed to make creative coding more accessible. 
				It allows you to create interactive visuals, animations, and even generative art with relatively simple code. 
				While I haven’t fully mastered it yet, I found it exciting to explore its possibilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another highlight for me was the introduction to <strong>physical computing</strong>. This involves using hardware like sensors, 
				microcontrollers, and actuators to create interactive systems that respond to the physical world. We primarily worked with 
				<strong>Arduino boards</strong>, which made it easier to connect and program hardware components. It was fascinating to see 
				how programming could extend beyond the screen and into tangible, real-world applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the course of the semester, I realized that programming gives us great independence from, for example, paid services. 
				It empowers us to create our own tools and solutions, which is both challenging and rewarding.
